Initially Pair Programming was one of the practice of XP (Extreme Programming), but currently it find it's own place in the modern agile programming methodologies. The main advantage of Pair Programming is quality of code developers produce using this technique. A bit less important is it’s option to protect project from the low "[Bus Factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor)".

In our company we do not practice Pair Programming widely (in it’s initial meaning), but it is usual thing our senior or mid developer sitting with junior and helping he/she to code and implement some complex features. Although we do not practising this permanently, we just do this occasionally and each developer in our company has his own working place with individual workstation. And in order to increase quality of our code we are using GitHub flow with developing each feature in separate branch with pull-request and following code review. For some quite large and complex projects we are set-upping and configure Continues Integration flow and also trying to follow BDD technique.
