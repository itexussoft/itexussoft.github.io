Nowadays there is a lot of buzz around _Microservices_ architecture pattern. Wikipedia defines this architecture as 
"[a more concrete and modern interpretation of service-oriented architectures (SOA) used to build distributed software systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices)". 
Personally I can not completely agree with statement that _Microservices_ architecture is just interpretation of SOA but I'm agree with that this is modern architecture :)
And as all modern it tries to adopt and use all the best plasticises and principles (not only those connected to the architecture design but also development and programming practices).
That the reason why _Microservices_ architecture is thing which is worth to check and get familiarity with. And I hope the following book will help you with this:

It is written as series of blog posts and provide short and clear introduction into the _Microservices_.
